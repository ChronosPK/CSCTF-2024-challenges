  Remember John? Well, it seems like his <u>close</u> friend uses weak passwords as well.
  He thinks that combining a password from `rockyou.txt` and his own year of birth will create a strong password. 

  His password's hash is `077987b2cfc07b9a84a0007f288e9ed7`. Can you find his password? <br>
  You already know the password format: `word_year`.  

  <br>

  Flag format: **`CSCTF{password}`**
