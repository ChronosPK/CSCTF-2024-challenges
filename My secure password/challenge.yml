  You just entered a Linux machine while doing a pentest.<br>
  Out of curiosity, you extract the system files that
  allow you to see the users and their encrypted passwords.

  Your task is to crack the hashes and submit the **longest password**. <br>
  It might also take you a long time to crack them.
