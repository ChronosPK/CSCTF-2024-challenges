  I will show you 2 ways to view stored Wi-Fi passwords.<br>
  (As long as you didn't delete them)

  **There are 2 ways to see stored Wi-Fi passwords**.

  **The first one** involves browsing your Windows file system. <br>
  - Go to `C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Wlansvc\Profiles\Interfaces`
  - Choose one of the Wi-Fi interfaces
  - Select one of the network files
  - Now decode the string between the `<hex>` elements
  - This is your plaintext password

  <br>

  **The second one** requires a few Batch commands. <br> 
  - Open Windows Command Prompt (WIN+R, type `cmd`)
  - Type `wlan show profiles` and select a profile;
  - Now retrieve the associated password: `wlan show profile "Profile_name" key=clear`;

  <br>

  I created some scripts and executables on my GitHub profile
  that will let you see **all** Wi-Fi passwords. (For both Windows and Unix OS). 
  Just find <a href="https://github.com/ChronosPK" target="_blank"><u>the right repo</u></a> and download them.

  BTW, the flag is the name of the last wireless network in the image I used for the Windows demo.

  <br>

  Flag format: **`CSCTF{network_name}`**
