  A proxy may refer to a person who is authorized to act for another 
  or it may designate the function or authority of serving in another's stead. 
  In the latter sense, it generally is preceded by the word "by" ("vote by proxy").

  Do you think we need some kind of proxy in web exploitation? <br>
  Answer: We definitely do! <br>
  Why? To analyze data that is sent and received, to modify it, and more!
