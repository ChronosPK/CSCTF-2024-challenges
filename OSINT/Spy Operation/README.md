## Description
```
Find information about a man based on the car he was registered for sometime in the past.
```

<br>

## Requirements
- OSINT databases
- Public records search

<br>

## Solve
Use OSINT resources to view the car owners. <br>
[One of the resources](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1EC0sKA_W9znzsxUt0wye9UYtyATXw5m8/edit#gid=1703031979) given in the Discord server shows the site that helps you find who you are looking for.

You know he owned a Porche Panamera in 2012, so you select those options. <br>
Get to [this page](https://carsowners.net/porsche/panamera/2012/al) and search `Gualtieri`:
```
