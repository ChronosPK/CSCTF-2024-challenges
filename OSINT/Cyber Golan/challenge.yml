  A friend of mine snapped a picture of a cybersecurity car 
  and provoked me to find out where the car was! <br>
  To make sure that I really knew the location, he also demands 
  I send him the **3 words** that describe the car's exact location.

  For example, he said that he was exactly at `wires.distract.torch`. 
  To help me out, he mentioned that the first word that describes the car's location starts with the letter "d".
