# VirusTotal.exe
Author: [Marin Radu](https://github.com/ChronosPK)

<br>

## Description
```
The file is not an executable. 
Simply open it with a text editor to view the contents and retrieve the flag.
```

<br>

## Requirements
- File identification

<br>

## Solve
Ignore the deceptive `.exe` extension. 
Use a text editor to open `TOTALLY-NOT-A-VIRUS.exe` which is actually a text file containing the flag.

<br>

> Flag: `CSCTF{yes_it_is_that_easy...for_now}`
