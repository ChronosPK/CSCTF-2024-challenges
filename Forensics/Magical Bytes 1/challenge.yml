  How does a computer even know what type of file this is?
  Do you know how it verifies such things? Does it need a signature of sorts?

  This is the <u>magic of bytes</u>, and you should understand 
  how simple file types like **PNG**, **GIF** or **JPG** are structured. 
  Knowing this will help you solve this challenge (and not only).

  When you analyze this file, don't forget to use your <u>head</u>!
