  Did you check our ticketing system? It is on the <a href="https://discord.gg/GucSYEKvHP" target="_blank">Discord server</a>!

  Here is how it works: if you have a problem with a challenge,
  with the CTF's infrastructure, or something else related to the CSCTF 2024,
  you can open a ticket that will allow you to talk with an admin.

  Don't use this excessively, or it will get you banned!

  Also, there is a flag waiting for you in the afferent channel.
